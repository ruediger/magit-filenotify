* magit-filenotify --- Refresh status buffer when git tree changes
This module for [[http://magit.github.io/magit/][magit]] provides an auto update mode for the status buffer.  It
uses the file notification support that was added to Emacs 24.4.

This is an updated version of the obsolete =contrib/magit-inotify.el= mode.

Activate the mode inside the =magit-status= buffer by calling
=M-x magit-filenotify-mode [RET]=.  Repeat the same step to deactivate it again.

To always enable the mode when opening the =magit-status= buffer add
=magit-filenotify-mode= to the =magit-status-mode-hook=.
